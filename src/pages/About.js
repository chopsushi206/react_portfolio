        About
      </h2>
      I'm an aspiring full stack developer! Even though I haven't been in the
      industry long, I am constantly working to expand my skill set and
      knowledge-base. I am a mother, and one of my main hobbies is landscaping
      my fish tanks at home... I like to think that a mind of developer requires
      the same kind of skills as a landscaper. Each are in charge of the
      creation of the aesthetics and functionality of a self-sustaining little
      universe. How you expect something to work out, doesn't always result in
      what you expected, requiring you to be patient and adaptable to any
      challenge you might face.
